      "about": "About MY SPA MY SPA is a wellness planner for your beauty, wellness or sports offers. It enables every employee and external sales partners to make a verified reservation for a treatment whenever your guest asks you for it. From the moment you create a reservation, the guests are introduced in MY SPA. Arrangement components - packages and individual services - are transferred to MY SPA for fulfillment. In this case, they are already booked as fixed services on the guest invoice and are not billed additionally. Stay data, fellow travellers and their guest profiles are imported - with all personal data. The language of the guest determines the language of the customer documents, if translations are provided. So all reservation changes are visible in MY SPA, so that e.g. the room number is always up-to-date. Additionally booked treatments, item sales and gratuities are charged to the guest profile of the traveller or the main folio of the reservation. Guest checks can be generated at the spa desk for the guest to sign. Day Spa guests can be checked in to a Day Spa account, in this case they receive their final bill at the Front Office. Alternatively, we offer our web-based MY POS cash register as an add-on: transactions from MY SPA are settled directly and, depending on the country, may be signed for fiscal purposes. These sales and the used paymethod are also sent to the hotel system for information. Send Services and packages to MY SPA Services, which are included in the reservation, will be sent to MY SPA: No more mails or calls, the spa will be informed about any service, that is already booked on the guest's hotel invoice. Plan availabilities No need to know who can perform which treatment, is the person available, is the room free? When will the guest arrive? All this is handled comfortably in MY SPA.

This generation can be broadly summarized with two premises: personalized experiences over possessions and love for technology. Hotels that don’t adapt to these new preferences will be left behind. Luckily, technology is here to help! Providing an integral solution for hotels so they can seamlessly and cheaply adjust to this new trend was the main motivation when we created ViCO. ViCo stands for Virtual Concierge and it will become your new best employee and favorite tool!

Drawing inspiration from personalized seat selection models in various industries, such as theatres and aviation, we have crafted a solution tailored to the unique requirements of the hospitality industry. We are all used to having the flexibility to pre-select seats on airlines. Our mission is to bring this possibility to hotel guests to support personalization and improve the guest experience. We have also seen that this can be a revenue driver, with a third of guests saying they would pay to be able to select their room rather than having it assigned by the hotel. Hotels now have a chance to drive incremental revenue not just by upselling higher room categories but also by monetizing room selection for the room category that was originally booked. Additionally, this is a great tool to reward guests, ensuring they book time and time again. Use room selection as part of your direct booking strategy, supporting a channel shift and reducing costs, as no OTA or party can offer this today. Our platform integrates seamlessly with Apaleo, ensuring real-time automation. This alleviates front desk staff from manual tasks, allowing them more time to interact with guests and offer a unique hospitality experience. With efficient onboarding and minimal setup disruption, we offer hospitality leaders an edge in this competitive market while providing an immediate impact on profitability. Empower your guests to personalize their stay by selecting and guaranteeing their own room and add-ons to make their stay extra special, while your hotel unlocks new revenue streams.

Using the SuitePad tablets in their rooms, guests can book spa appointments, order roomservice, book activities, and much more—all with the click of a button. SuitePads open up channels of communication between hotel staff and guests that are not available with simple, paper-based guest directories. Using the SuitePad Backend, hotel staff can send push notifications directly to the SuitePads in guests’ rooms, creating a new and more interactive way of up-selling through the hotel’s outlets. In addition to their Digital Guest Directory, SuitePad tablets are also equipped with SuitePad Phone and SuitePad TV Control, allowing guests to make phone calls and control the hotel room TV through the SuitePad device in their room. SuitePad also has a “bring your own device” solution, called SuitePad BYOD, that allows guests to access their SuitePad interface through their personal mobile devices from any location. To help support front desk staff, SuitePad has created the SuitePad Lobby Screen that acts as an interactive information point for guests in the hotel lobby area. Most recently, SuitePad launched SuiteCast—a hotel room casting solution that enables guests to securely cast media content from their mobile devices to the TV in their hotel room. This solution is revolutionizing in-room entertainment for the hotel industry.

In a world where personal service and efficiency must go hand in hand, RoomPal offers hoteliers and accommodation providers an innovative solution to seamlessly blend both. Leveraging advanced voice assistant technology based on Amazon Alexa, RoomPal transforms any hotel room into an interactive guest experience. From personalizing the guest experience to optimizing operational workflows, RoomPal is designed to redefine the interaction between guest and host. Guests can conveniently control room functions, request services, or get local recommendations through their voice, while hoteliers benefit from the rich data to continuously improve and personalize their services. Integrating RoomPal into their offerings allows hoteliers to enhance guest comfort and satisfaction, and also to gain valuable insights into preferences and behaviors. This information is priceless for crafting future offerings and fine-tuning marketing strategies. RoomPal also relieves staff by answering frequently asked questions directly through the digital concierge, allowing them more time to focus on personalized service tasks that a machine cannot (yet) perform. RoomPal’s real-time translation capabilities make communication barriers a thing of the past, ensuring a hospitable environment no matter where guests come from. Planned future features include intelligent upselling based on past guest behavior to maximize revenue per room without being intrusive. The flexibility of RoomPal ensures it grows with a hotel’s changing needs and requirements. With RoomPal, hoteliers step into a new era of guest service – an era where innovation, personalization, and efficiency set the stage, providing guests with a stay as unique as their voice.

At the same time, the booking page has managed to become even more compact. One of the most striking innovations: The price calendar now shows two months at once. If the guest stays longer, the view grows dynamically to six months. There have also been improvements, updates and new functions in all other areas: With just a few clicks, hoteliers create a separate booking page for each combination of room category and rate – turning OnePageBooking into a landing page for targeted marketing campaigns. Quick views reveal all room details already in the overview and even non-bookers have been thought of: Half-completed booking sections can now be saved and shared with friends even more easily. Customised presentation OnePageBooking 6 is completely customised to the corporate identity of the hotel. The Internet Booking Engine integrates seamlessly into your website. Guests will not notice any difference. (Almost) anything is possible. We know that no two hotels are the same. Each has different needs, each has different target groups that need to be addressed. That's why we provide you with countless setting options. Increase conversion Book on just one page. Plus intelligent features that don't bore your guests, but make booking fun. The majority of our hotel customers achieve a higher conversion after switching to OnePageBooking 6. Upselling A simple room booking is no longer enough for many users. And rightly so.
